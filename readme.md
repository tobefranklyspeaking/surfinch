This app is for bird watchers (birders) to track sightings and compare with other birders in your Surfinch network.

Have you ever found yourself unable to digitally track bird sightings? This app will let you sign-up, login, and build a network of other birders posting their favorite photos of sightings.

Additionally, in this app, you are able to research essential bird data. Tracking is easy with the use of interactive forms and maps. Data will be stored to each user's profile and will be accessible during new sessions.
